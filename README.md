The HX711 breakout allows you to easily read the weight value from a load-cell sensor (mass sensor). This small ADC is of great precision and is capable of measuring very small changes in the load-cell resistance, whose signals are amplified with the built-in amplifier. Subsequently, this same information is digitally transmitted to a microcontroller that simply converts the numbers obtained into the actual weight. That's why this breakout is very useful for projects with scales or presence sensors, either for individuals or industry.




Breakout supports the connection of load cells that are made by the Wheatstone Bridge technique, like most of the load cells. They usually have four wires, two for power supply (E + and E, most often red and black), and two for signal (A + and A-, most commonly white and green wire). The pins for these wires are also indicated on the PCB and it is easy to connect.

## Repository contents

All Soldered Electronics hardware designed in KiCAD, and repositories are organized in the following way:

- CAD folder - contains KiCAD files (Schematics, Board, Panel Board), sorted by version. Change log lists all changes between versions.
- OUTPUTS - contains useful files, such as Bill of Materials (BOM), PDF of schematics, 3D .step file of the board and gerber files, sorted by version. 
- OUTPUTS -> Compliance - Certificates and useful legal stuff.
